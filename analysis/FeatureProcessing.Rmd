Now that we have our data split into two sections, we can start processing features.

In some cases with strings, if you want to make these a categorical variable, you need to make sure to incorporate levels from both sets of data.

```{r whatstrings}
stringcols<- sapply(titanic_train_c, is.character)
titanic_train_c[,stringcols]
```

```{r processclass}
convertclass<-function(x){ ordered(x , labels=c("3rd","2nd","1st"), levels=c("3rd","2nd","1st"))}
titanic_train_c$pclass <- convertclass(titanic_train_c$pclass )
titanic_test_c$pclass <- convertclass(titanic_test_c$pclass )
summary(titanic_train_c$pclass)
summary(titanic_test_c$pclass)
```

```{r processname}
titanic_train_c$name <- NULL
titanic_test_c$name <- NULL
```
